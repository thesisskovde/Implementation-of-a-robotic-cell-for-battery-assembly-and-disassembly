Abstract.
Since the Industrial Revolution, advances in robotics and automation have enhanced reliability, efficiency and precision in manufacturing. Recently, interest in integrating collaborative robots with vision systems to optimize production tasks has grown. At the same time, increasing environmental concerns have driven the introduction of circular economy principles, promoting reuse and recycling of components at the end of life. This thesis presents the design and construction of an automated station for assembling and disassembling modules. A collaborative robot with vision system is integrated capable of detecting and manipulating components within the station, and 3D printed fixtures are used to facilitate safe and correct handling. Experimental tests demonstrate the station's ability to perform both processes without human intervention. The resulting model offers a scalable solution for implementing cells circularity in sustainable industrial applications.
 
This code is make for the thesis: Implementation of a robotic cell for high precision battery assembly and disassembly.
